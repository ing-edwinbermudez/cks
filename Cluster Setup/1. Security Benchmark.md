## 🛡️ Tool Overview: CIS-CAT Lite

**CIS-CAT Lite** is a free security assessment tool developed by the **Center for Internet Security (CIS)**. It is a foundational utility used to check system configurations against recognized security standards.

### 📝 Key Function

The primary function of CIS-CAT Lite is to **evaluate a system's security configuration** by comparing it against the authoritative **CIS Benchmarks**—globally recognized security configuration standards.

### 🛠️ Features and Usage

* **Configuration Audit:** Scans the target system's configuration (OS, cloud services, containers, etc.) to assess compliance.
* **Compliance Baseline:** Uses the **CIS Benchmarks**, which are prescriptive, expert-consensus guides for secure configurations.
* **Cost and Scope:** It is the **free, limited version** of the paid **CIS-CAT Pro** product, designed for basic assessment functionality.
* **Reporting:** Generates a compliance report, typically restricted to **HTML** format. The report includes:
    * A clear **compliance score** (e.g., a percentage).
    * A list of configuration failures or deviations.
    * Steps for **remediation** to correct insecure settings.
* **Flexibility:** Can be used to scan target systems both **locally** and **remotely**.
