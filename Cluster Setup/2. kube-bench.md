# kube-bench

**Kube-bench** is an open-source tool designed to check whether your Kubernetes cluster configuration meets the security recommendations defined in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark:** This is a set of best practices and recommendations developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) for securely configuring Kubernetes components (like the API server, controller manager, scheduler, etc.) and cluster nodes.

- **Auditing:** Kube-bench automates the process of auditing a Kubernetes cluster against these defined security controls.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Kube-bench is usually run inside or against a Kubernetes cluster.

1. **Selection of Benchmark:** It automatically detects the version of Kubernetes running and selects the appropriate version of the CIS Benchmark to use (e.g., CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.23.0).

2. **Test Execution:** It runs a series of tests categorized by the component they are auditing (e.g., Master Node Security, Worker Node Security, etc.).

3. **Component Interaction:**
    - For Master/Control Plane tests, it checks configurations of components like kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager.

    - For Node/Worker tests, it checks components like kubelet and container runtime.

4. **Reporting:** It generates a report detailing which checks passed, failed, or needed manual investig.

## 🏃 Running Kube-bench

Kube-bench can be run in several ways:
- Standalone Binary: You can install the binary on a Linux server and run it directly against a cluster.

- Docker Container: It can be run as a Docker container, often mounting necessary host directories to read configuration files.

- Kubernetes Job: The most common way to run it is as a Kubernetes Job. This allows the tool to run a set of pods across the cluster nodes, which then self-terminate upon completion, gathering results from all nodes.

## 📝 Typical OutputT

The output is structured and easy to read, highlighting three key statuses:

| **Status** | **Meaning** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PASS**  | The configuration meets the CIS recommendation. |
| **FAIL**  | The configuration violates the CIS recommendation. This indicates a potential security issue. |
| **INFO**  | An informational check that doesn't have a pass/fail state. These are often used for checks that require manual inspection. |
| **WARN**  | A check that needs manual investigation or a specific setting to be confirmed. Similar to INFO, but usually for a more critical setting. |
